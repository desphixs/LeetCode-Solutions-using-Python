Letâ€™s analyze the time and space complexity of the `longestCommonPrefix` function.

### Code

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""

    prefix = strs[0]

    for string in strs[1:]:
        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
            prefix = prefix[:-1]

    return prefix
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initial Prefix**: Setting `prefix` to the first string takes `O(m)` time, where `m` is the length of the first string.

2. **For Loop**: The `for` loop iterates over the remaining `n - 1` strings. For each string:

    - **While Loop**: The `while` loop may run up to `O(m)` times in the worst case, where `m` is the length of the `prefix`.

3. **Slicing Operations**: Each slicing operation `string[:len(prefix)]` takes `O(m)` time in the worst case. Removing the last character from `prefix` (`prefix = prefix[:-1]`) also takes `O(m)` time.

Combining these:

-   The `while` loop may run up to `m` times for each of the `n - 1` strings.
-   Each iteration of the `while` loop involves slicing operations that are proportional to the length of `prefix`.

Overall, the worst-case time complexity is **O(n \* m^2)**, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the longest string. This is because, in the worst case, you might need to perform multiple slicing operations proportional to the length of `prefix` for each string.

### Space Complexity

1. **Prefix Storage**: The space required to store the `prefix` is `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the prefix.

2. **Other Variables**: The space used by other variables (`string`, etc.) is minimal and constant.

Therefore, the space complexity is **O(m)**, where `m` is the length of the longest string in the list.

### Summary

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m^2)` where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the longest string.
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the longest string.
