### Detailed Approach and Solution

1. **Initialization**

    - **Check for Empty Input**: If the input list `strs` is empty, return an empty string immediately because there are no strings to compare.

    ```python
    if not strs:
        return ""
    ```

    - **Start with the First String**: Initialize the `prefix` with the first string in the list. This is because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the first string.

    ```python
    prefix = strs[0]
    ```

2. **Iterate Over Remaining Strings**

    - **Loop Through Strings**: Iterate through each string in the list starting from the second string (i.e., `strs[1:]`).

    ```python
    for string in strs[1:]:
    ```

3. **Adjust Prefix**

    - **Check Prefix Matching**: For each string, check if the beginning part of the string matches the `prefix`. This is done by slicing the string to the length of the current `prefix` and comparing it with the `prefix`.

    ```python
    while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:
    ```

    - **Shorten Prefix**: If the current string does not start with the `prefix`, reduce the length of the `prefix` by removing its last character. This process continues until the `prefix` matches the beginning of the current string or becomes empty.

    ```python
    prefix = prefix[:-1]
    ```

    - **Early Exit**: If at any point the `prefix` becomes empty (meaning no common prefix exists), exit the loop early to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

    ```python
    if not prefix:
        break
    ```

4. **Return Result**

    - **Final Prefix**: After processing all strings, the remaining `prefix` is the longest common prefix shared by all strings. Return this value.

    ```python
    return prefix
    ```

### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s walk through an example with the input list `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`:

1. **Initialization**:

    - `prefix` is set to `"flower"` (the first string).

2. **Iterate Over Remaining Strings**:

    - **First Iteration (`"flow"`)**:

        - Compare `"flow"` with `"flower"`:
            - `"flow"` does not start with `"flower"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"flower" -> "flowe"`.
            - `"flow"` does not start with `"flowe"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"flowe" -> "flow"`.
            - `"flow"` matches `"flow"`.
        - Continue to next string.

    - **Second Iteration (`"flight"`)**:
        - Compare `"flight"` with `"flow"`:
            - `"flight"` does not start with `"flow"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"flow" -> "flo"`.
            - `"flight"` does not start with `"flo"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"flo" -> "fl"`.
            - `"flight"` does not start with `"fl"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"fl" -> "f"`.
            - `"flight"` does not start with `"f"`.
            - Remove last character from `prefix`: `"f" -> ""`.
        - The `prefix` is now empty.

3. **Return Result**:
    - The function returns an empty string because there is no common prefix among all the strings.

The approach involves:

1. Starting with the first string as the initial prefix.
2. Iterating over the remaining strings.
3. Adjusting the prefix by shortening it when necessary.
4. Returning the longest common prefix or an empty string if no common prefix exists.
