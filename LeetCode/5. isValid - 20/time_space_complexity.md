The time and space complexity for the bracket validation code are as follows:

### Time Complexity

-   **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

    **Explanation:**

    -   The function iterates through each character in the input string exactly once.
    -   For each character, the operations performed (push, pop, or check) are \(O(1)\) operations.
    -   Therefore, the time complexity of the function is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity

-   **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

    **Explanation:**

    -   The stack stores at most \(n\) characters (in the worst case where all characters are opening brackets).
    -   If the input string is fully valid but consists only of opening brackets, the stack will have \(n\) elements.
    -   Hence, the space complexity of the function is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.

In summary:

-   **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
-   **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

This is efficient for this problem since each bracket is processed in constant time, and the stack space grows linearly with the number of brackets.
