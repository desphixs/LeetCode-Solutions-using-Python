"""

1. **Class Definition:**
   - `class Solution(object):` defines a new class named `Solution`.

2. **Method Definition:**
   - `def isValid(self, s):` defines a method `isValid` that belongs to the `Solution` class. It takes one argument, `s`, which is the string to be checked for valid brackets.

3. **Stack Initialization:**
   - `stack = []` initializes an empty list to serve as a stack for tracking opening brackets.

4. **Iterating Over Characters:**
   - `for i in s:` loops through each character `i` in the input string `s`.

5. **Processing Opening Brackets:**
   - `if i in "({[":` checks if the character `i` is one of the opening brackets.
   - `stack.append(i)` adds the opening bracket to the stack.

6. **Processing Closing Brackets:**
   - `elif i in ")}]":` checks if the character `i` is one of the closing brackets.
   - `if not stack:` checks if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns `False`.
   - `if i == ")" and stack[-1] == "(":` checks if the current closing bracket matches the top of the stack.
   - `stack.pop()` removes the top element from the stack if there is a match.

7. **Final Check:**
   - `return not stack` returns `True` if the stack is empty after processing all characters (indicating all opening brackets had matching closing brackets). Otherwise, it returns `False`.

8. **Test Execution Block:**
   - `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures the following code runs only if the script is executed directly.
   - `sol = Solution()` creates an instance of the `Solution` class.
   - `test_strings = [...]` defines a list of test strings with various bracket sequences to test.
   - `for s in test_strings:` loops through each test string.
   - `print(f"isValid({s}): {sol.isValid(s)}")` prints the result of the `isValid` method for each test string in a readable format.
