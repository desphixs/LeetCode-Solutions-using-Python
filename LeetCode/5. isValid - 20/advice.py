I’m starting to get the hang of problem-solving after tackling the first five questions, and I’m definitely seeing some progress! Here’s some advice I’d like to share, which might be helpful for anyone on a similar journey:

1. **Celebrate Your Wins**: Every problem solved, even with hints, is a step forward. Recognizing and celebrating these victories helps build confidence and motivation.

2. **Understand the Concepts**: Focus on grasping the underlying concepts and patterns in problems. This deeper understanding will make it easier to tackle similar problems in the future with less reliance on hints.

3. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key. The more problems you solve, the more you’ll recognize patterns and strategies, reducing your need for hints over time.

4. **Reflect on Solutions**: After solving a problem, take time to review and understand why your solution works. Try to write your own explanation or reimplement the solution from scratch without looking at the code.

5. **Learn from Mistakes**: If you get stuck or make mistakes, use these moments as learning opportunities. Analyze what went wrong and how you can improve.

6. **Challenge Yourself**: Gradually increase the difficulty of the problems you tackle. This will help you grow and prepare you for more complex challenges.

7. **Seek Help Strategically**: It’s okay to seek hints or guidance when needed, but try to solve the problem on your own first. Over time, you’ll find that you need less assistance.

8. **Stay Persistent**: Problem-solving skills improve with time and effort. Keep pushing through challenges, and you’ll build the confidence and ability to solve problems more independently.

Remember, the journey in coding and problem-solving is a marathon, not a sprint. With persistence and practice, you’ll reach a point where solving problems becomes more intuitive and less reliant on external help. Keep up the great work my friend and let's keep solving!
