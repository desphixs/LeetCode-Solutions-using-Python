### Detailed Explanation:

1. **`ListNode` class**: 
   - This is a basic definition of a node in a linked list. Each node holds a `value` (`val`) and a reference to the next node (`next`).

2. **`to_linked_list` function**: 
   - Converts a Python list (like `[1, 2, 4]`) into a linked list using a dummy node (`dummy`) to simplify list creation. It loops over the Python list, creating a new `ListNode` for each element and linking them together.

3. **`to_python_list` function**: 
   - Converts a linked list back to a Python list for easier viewing. It iterates through the linked list, appending each node's value to a Python list.

4. **`Solution` class**:
   - This class defines the main solution for merging two sorted linked lists (`list1` and `list2`).
   - It uses a `dummy` node (`base`) to simplify list merging.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as both linked lists have nodes. It compares the values of the current nodes and attaches the smaller node to the merged list.
   - Once one list is exhausted, it attaches the remaining part of the other list.

5. **`current = current.next`**:
   - This is necessary to move the `current` pointer in the merged list forward, so the next node can be attached in the following iterations.

6. **Final part**:
   - Python lists (`list1` and `list2`) are first converted to linked lists, merged using the `mergeTwoLists` function, and then converted back to Python lists for easier visualization.

This is a standard and efficient approach to solving the problem of merging two sorted linked lists."
