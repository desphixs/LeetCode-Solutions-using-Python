The thought process and approach behind the `romanToInt` solution can be broken down into several key ideas:

### 1. **Understanding the Roman Numeral System**:

Roman numerals are normally written from the largest to smallest value, left to right (e.g., XV = 15). However, there are exceptions, such as IV (4) and IX (9), where a smaller numeral is placed before a larger one to indicate subtraction. This is central to the solution's logic: when the current numeral is smaller than the next one, we subtract its value instead of adding it.

### 2. **Use of a Lookup Table (Dictionary)**:

A dictionary is used to map Roman numeral characters (`I`, `V`, `X`, etc.) to their corresponding integer values. This allows for quick and efficient lookups during iteration.

### 3. **Iterating Through the String**:

The approach involves iterating through the input string, checking each Roman numeral. Since Roman numerals are processed based on their order, the algorithm checks whether the current numeral is less than the next one to decide whether to add or subtract its value. This approach leverages the fact that subtraction only occurs when a smaller numeral is placed before a larger one.

### 4. **Condition for Subtraction**:

The core of the logic is the comparison:

```python
if roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
    total -= roman[s[i]]
```

When the current numeral is smaller than the next one (e.g., in "IX" where `I` is less than `X`), it means subtraction is required.

### 5. **Final Addition**:

Since the loop only iterates until the second-to-last character, the value of the last character is always added at the end to ensure it's included in the total.

### Thought Process in Approach:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution handles various Roman numeral patterns by implementing subtraction and addition based on the numeral order, which ensures that irregular patterns like IV and IX are processed correctly.

2. **Efficiency**: By using a dictionary for constant-time lookups and iterating through the string once (O(n) time complexity), the solution is efficient, even for large inputs.

3. **Modularity**: The logic for converting individual Roman characters is modular, using the dictionary for easy expansion if additional numeral systems were to be added.

This method ensures that the problem is tackled systematically by breaking down the rules of Roman numerals into a clear and logical sequence of operations.
