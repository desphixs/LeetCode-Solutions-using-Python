### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**:

    ```python
    number_dict = {}
    ```

    - This takes constant time, \( O(1) \).

2. **Iteration Over List**:

    ```python
    for index, value in enumerate(nums):
    ```

    - This loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each iteration includes operations that are checked below.

3. **Calculate the Complement**:

    ```python
    diff = target - value
    ```

    - This is a constant-time operation, \( O(1) \).

4. **Check for the Complement in Dictionary**:

    ```python
    if diff in number_dict:
    ```

    - Checking if a key is in a dictionary takes average constant time, \( O(1) \).

5. **Update the Dictionary**:
    ```python
    number_dict[value] = index
    ```
    - Adding an element to a dictionary takes average constant time, \( O(1) \).

**Overall Time Complexity**:

-   Each operation inside the loop is \( O(1) \), and the loop itself runs `n` times.
-   Thus, the time complexity of the `twoSum` function is \( O(n) \), where `n` is the length of the `nums` list.

### Space Complexity

1. **Space for Dictionary**:

    ```python
    number_dict = {}
    ```

    - The dictionary can potentially store all `n` elements if no solution is found before reaching the end of the list. This requires \( O(n) \) space.

2. **Other Variables**:
    - Variables like `index`, `value`, and `diff` use constant space, \( O(1) \).

**Overall Space Complexity**:

-   The primary space used is for the dictionary, which can grow to the size of the input list. Thus, the space complexity is \( O(n) \).

### Summary

-   **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) — Linear in the number of elements in the input list because each element is processed once.
-   **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) — Linear in the number of elements in the input list due to the space used by the dictionary.

### How to Check Complexity:

1. **Analyze Each Operation**: Break down the code to determine the time complexity of each operation.
2. **Count Iterations**: Determine how many times loops or recursive calls execute.
3. **Assess Space Usage**: Look at how much memory is used by data structures like lists, dictionaries, etc., and how it scales with the input size.
