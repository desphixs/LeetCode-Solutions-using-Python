1. **Function Definition**:

    ```python
    def twoSum(nums, target):
    ```

    - Defines the function `twoSum` that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

2. **Docstring**:

    ```python
    """
    Finds two numbers in the list `nums` that add up to the `target` sum.
    Returns the indices of these two numbers.
    ```

    - Provides a description of what the function does, its arguments, and its return value.

3. **Initialize the Dictionary**:

    ```python
    number_dict = {}
    ```

    - Creates an empty dictionary `number_dict` to store numbers and their indices.

4. **Iterate Over the List**:

    ```python
    for index, value in enumerate(nums):
    ```

    - Loops through each number in `nums`, where `index` is the current index and `value` is the current number.

5. **Calculate the Complement**:

    ```python
    diff = target - value
    ```

    - Computes the complement (`diff`) that, when added to `value`, equals the `target`.

6. **Check for the Complement**:

    ```python
    if diff in number_dict:
        return [index, number_dict[diff]]
    ```

    - Checks if the complement (`diff`) is already in the dictionary `number_dict`.
    - If found, returns the current index and the index of the complement.

7. **Update the Dictionary**:

    ```python
    else:
        number_dict[value] = index
    ```

    - If the complement is not found, adds the current number (`value`) and its index to the dictionary `number_dict`.

8. **Test and Print Result**:
    ```python
    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    result = twoSum(nums, 9)
    print(result)
    ```
    - Defines a list `nums` and a `target` value, calls the `twoSum` function with these inputs, and prints the result.

### Explanation of the Steps:

1. **Initialization**:

    - An empty dictionary `number_dict` is used to keep track of the numbers seen so far and their indices.

2. **Iteration**:

    - For each number in the list, compute what number is needed to reach the target sum (`diff`).

3. **Complement Check**:

    - Check if this required number (`diff`) is already in the dictionary. If it is, then the two numbers that add up to the target have been found.

4. **Update Dictionary**:

    - If the complement is not found, store the current number and its index in the dictionary for future reference.

5. **Return Indices**:
    - Once a valid pair is found, the function returns their indices.

This approach efficiently finds the two numbers that sum up to the target with a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
