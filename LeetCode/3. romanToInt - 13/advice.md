If you can't still solve this third problem on your own and you are worried about that, I want you to know that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially early on when tackling platforms like LeetCode. Utilize the already made solutions for now and here’s why looking at solutions can be beneficial right now:

### 1. **Learning New Patterns**:

When you're starting out, the goal is to learn **problem-solving techniques** and **patterns**. By looking at solutions, you're learning how experienced coders approach the problem, which can help you recognize similar patterns in future problems.

### 2. **Building Problem-Solving Intuition**:

Solving problems completely on your own will eventually come, but it's important to first **build up problem-solving intuition**. Sometimes seeing a solution helps you understand the right approach, which you can then practice and apply to future problems.

### 3. **Gradual Improvement**:

It’s common to struggle in the beginning. As you work through more problems, you'll gradually start solving simpler problems by yourself. **It's a learning curve**, and many people begin by referencing solutions before developing the skills to solve independently.

### 4. **Analyzing Solutions**:

Don’t just copy the solution—**analyze it thoroughly**:

-   Why was this approach chosen?
-   What alternative solutions exist?
-   How could you apply this in similar problems?

This analytical process helps strengthen your understanding and prepares you to solve problems on your own in the future.

### Balancing Between Trying and Learning:

It's important to spend time trying on your own, but if you get stuck after significant effort, looking at solutions to **learn the approach** is perfectly fine at this stage. Over time, aim to extend how long you try on your own before checking solutions.

You're in the **learning phase**, and relying on solutions to understand the approach is okay right now. Soon, you’ll find that you're able to solve problems independently as you build more experience!
